Data Featurization¶

Most machine learning algorithms require that input data form vectors. However, input data for drug-discovery datasets routinely come in the format of lists of molecules and associated experimental readouts. To
transform lists of molecules into vectors, we need to subclasses of DeepChem loader class dc.data.DataLoader such as dc.data.CSVLoader or dc.data.SDFLoader. Users can subclass dc.data.DataLoader to load arbitrary file formats. All loaders must be passed a dc.feat.Featurizer object. DeepChem provides a number of different subclasses of dc.feat.Featurizer for convenience


Graph Convolutional Networks

deep learning on graphs with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), a powerful type of neural network designed to work directly on graphs and leverage their structural information.

    L1 regularization: 
        The cost is proportional to the absolute value of the weights coefficients (L1 norm of the weights).

    L2 regularization: 
        The cost is proportional to the square of the value of the weight coefficients (l2 norm of the weights)

Hyperparameters

All models were trained on Stanford’s GPU clusters via DeepChem. No model was allowed
to train for more than 10 hours(time profile in Table 4. Users can reproduce benchmarks
locally by following directions from DeepChem.
Hyperparameters were determined using Gaussian Process Optimization via pyGPGO
(https://github.com/hawk31/pyGPGO), with max number of iterations set to 20. Optimized hyperparameters for each model are listed, detailed hyperparameters can be found on
Deepchem.
